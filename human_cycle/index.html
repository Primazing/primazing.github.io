<h1 style="color:#FFB6C1;font-size:50px;background-color:#F08080;">The Human Cycle </h1>


<div style="color:#FF00FF;font-size:29px">
<p>Now let me guess your here to learn about the human cycle.</p>
<p>If you are please feel free to read on.</p>
<p>Today in cycle school we will be learning about the human cycle.</p>
<p>On this website we will learn about all the different stages of the human cycle.</p>
<p> Once you have read all the stages there will be a quiz at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>{oh and BTW this is a very long website, so if your looking for one specific paragraph I advice skip to the bit that you are looking for.}</p> 
<h2 style="color:lightpink;font-size:50px;background-color:deeppink;">Newborn and Baby</h2>


<div style="color:#FF69B4;font-size:29px">
<p>The very first stage of the human cycle is new born.</p>
<p>New born is when the human has come out straight from the parents stomache.</p>
<p>Newborn is when the human has been alive for 4 weeks{1 month}.</p>
<p>Newborn usually refers to a baby from birth to about 2 months of age.</p>
<p>When the human goes from newborn to a baby they start to understand some things but not yet all things.</p>
<p>Which means you could start to teach it to walk.</p>
<img src="cutebaby.jpg"class="responsive" style="width:100%;height:auto;"/>


<p>If its unable to walk try crawling first.<br/>{BTW most people start with crawling before going into walking}.</p>
<h3 style="color:plum;font-size:50px;background-color:darkviolet;">food for a baby and for a new born</h3>
<img src="food for baby.jpg"class="responsive" style="width:100%;height:auto;"/>

<div style="color:purple;font-size:29px">
<p>Some of the baby food brands in the uk are:
<ol>
	<li>Ella's Kitchen</li>
	<li>Cows Gate </li>
	<li>Organix</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Newborns usually drink milk produced from the mother<br/> nothing else beacuse newborns dont have teeth to chew their food.</p>
<p>But when they grow into the baby stage they dont just have to drink milk<br/>they can start having some special snacks just for babys such as:
<ol>
	<li>rice cakes</li>
	<li>Veggie Straws.</li>
	<li>porridge</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Unfortuneatly,consumer health group says almost all baby food contains at least one toxic chemical. </p>
<p>Researchers said the amounts of toxins in baby food are small<br/> but the chemical contamination can build up over time. </p>
<p>Experts advise parents to avoid rice-based products and feed infants foods such as oatmeal.</p>
<p>Thats it for babys and newborns<br/>Time for toddlers</p>
<h3 style="color:#00FFFF;font-size:50px;background-color:#6495ED;">Toddlers</h3>
<img src="Fotball boy.jpg"class="responsive" style="width:100%;height:auto;"/>
<p>Now toddlers they understand even more things now than when the human was a baby.</p>
<p>Once they have learnt to walk you can teach them sports.</p>
<p>A toddler is normally when the human is 12 to 36 months.</p>
<p> The toddler years are a time of great cognitive, emotional and social development.</p>
<p>The word is derived from "to toddle"<br/> which means to walk unsteadily, like a child of this age.</p>
<p>Toddlers are a lot like teenagers, which means they can be very moody.</p>
<p>They are either ecstatic or enraged, and their moods are variable.</p>
<p>They also tend to have a hard time making transitions<br/> such as going from sleep to waking or switching from one activity to another.</p>
<p>Toddlers sometimes have trouble controlling their emotions.</p>
<p>A young child has had very little practice in managing his changing moods and emotions<br/> so he's very easily swept away by strong feelings</p>
<p>Toddlers don't have the logic and reasoning skills to move beyond their outrage.</p>
<p>Now moving on to the good things about toddlers</p>
<p>Here is a short list of things you can still enjoy about toddlers even though they changing so fast!</p>
<ol>
	<li>The joy they get from the smallest things.</li>
	<li>They're perfectly cuddly.</li>
	<li>They still take naps.</li>
	<li>Their style is unique.</li>
	<li>They have no filter.</li>
	<li>They still need you.</li>
	
</ol>
</p>
<p>They have tons of energy<br/>Toddlers seem to have an endless supply of energy and it can be challenging to keep up.</p>
<p>Which is good at some times but bad if you trying to put them to sleep.</p>
<p>They love to learn which is extra good because then you will have a good educated child <br/>who is most likely to forfill a dream and succeed at it.</p>
<p>They are ready for a big-kid bed so you adults dont need to be squashed up in bed every night.</p>
<p>They always want to help.</p>
<p>They need discipline.</p>
<p>And the best of all they soak up your love and affection.</p>
<p>Once they have got to a sertain point in life they can start going to nurserys.</p>
<p>In the nursery they will help your child with all sorts of useful things.</p>
<p>Like in P.E the will help your child achive the skill of balence and acuracy</p>

<p>I hope you've learnt alot of things to either help your toddler of just to learn about them for fun.</p>  
<p>Now its time to move on to move on to child.</p> 
<h3 style="color:#FFA500;font-size:50px;background-color:#FFA07A ;">Child</h3>

<p>Now children let me see,ah ha they are quite responsible and senseble.</p>
<p>Racing To Grow. A child's brain has its most dramatic growth period from birth until the age of 5.</p>
<p>Know How To Party. Babies and kids can laugh up to 300 times a day!</p>
<p>A child is when the human is about 3-12 years old.</p>
<p>From that age children start to experience technolegy and what it can do.</p>
<p>They start to get interested in games mabye on a ipad or a phone.</p>
<p>Most games have a age limit so I surgest go to the website net aware.</p>
<p>That website shows the official age limit <br/>,the age that childen think it should be and <br/>what adulds think it sould be.</p>
<p>Children at the ages from 4-11 will go to a primary school.</p>
<p>Here is a list that shows the ages and the year groups up until year 6</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ages 4-5 is Reception</li>
	<li>Ages 5-6 is year 1 </li>
	<li>Ages 6-7 is year 2</li>
	<li>Ages 7-8 is year 3</li>
	<li>Ages 8-9 is year 4</li>
	<li>Ages 9-10 is year 5</li>
	<li>Ages 10-11 is year 6</li>
</ol>
<p>In school the children learn alot but <br/> you still need to do learning at home; just a little bit though. </p>
<p>Too much learning can throw them off because their brains hasn't had a time to relax.</p>
<p>So it is very important to stay relaxed and calm and not getting too stressed.</p>
<p>Learning is a crucial part of the childs life because it helps the figure difficult things as the get older.</p>
<p>Now,talking about things most of you adulds will benefit from the most,<br/>How to prevent tantrums from happening!</p>
<p>The first thing about prevent tantrums is to give them lots of attention. </p>
<p>If the child{children}don't get attention they feel alone and that causes them the do what ever it takes to get your attention.</p>
<p>Also it's good to feed them on time so they don't get cranky and to make sure the get enough sleep.</p>
<p>Going back to talking about education it is so important for a child to learn how to read. </p>
<p>Here are some reasons why it's so important for a child to read</p>
