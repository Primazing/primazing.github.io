Planet Musicorum

Once upon a time there lived a young girl called Tallia. She had long, honey-brown hair that was about the same colour as her beloved guitar. Her guitar had a sticker of a unicorn on the back of it. Her family hated music so she had to go over to her friend Hayden’s house to play it. The fact that her family did not like music was bad news for Tallia because it was her favourite thing in the world. She would play a beautiful chord followed by the nonstop beat of a long guitar strum. Then, she would open her mouth and sing a tune, her voice like silk.  But her mother would always come bustling into the room, shouting “TALLIA! You stop playing music at once or I will take your guitar and smash it!”<br/> 

Tallia’s mother never did smash her guitar though because she knew how much music meant to her daughter. But to her mother, it was nothing but a bunch of noises collided together to make one, terrible sound. She never smashed the guitar because Tallia would always hang her head and go to Hayden’s house to play her guitar. 

One rainy morning, Tallia was laying on her bed glumly. She was glum because she couldn’t play her guitar and couldn’t go over to Hayden’s because he and his family were on holiday. “I wish,” said Tallia out loud, turning to face her guitar. “that I could live in a world of music.”
Then, she grabbed her guitar and played a quiet chord. “I wish! I really, truly wish! That I could live in a woooooooooorld...of music!” She sung this time.
Suddenly, a large, purple swirl appeared in the air. Tallia felt herself drifting towards it. She was mesmerised by the mystical look of the swirl. She was just an inch away from it, then a centimetre, then a millimetre. After that, she was inside the swirl! Her vision went berserk and the world was spinning. She rose into the air and everything became blurry. She got higher and higher, flying through the roof! It wasn’t until she felt a soft, cotton cloud that she closed her eyes in fear. Suddenly, she felt herself falling and falling. She didn’t open her eyes as she was falling. She was afraid she was going to meet her death!

When she hit the ground, it didn’t hurt at all! She slowly opened her eyes and sat up. She realised she was sitting on top of a gigantic pan flute and was very confused. She looked up and saw the sky. The sky that she fell from. It was as blue as ever, with the cotton candy clouds and the gleaming sun. She looked around and saw that there were walking instruments waddling around the pan flute. “OMG!” She thought. “Where am I? I must’ve taken a concussion during that fall. Wait, how did that fall even happen? I must’ve dreamt the whole thing!” 
She pinched herself hard and found that her situation was very much real. She got up and looked around nervously. She walked across the pan flute for thirty five minutes but it looked like the pan flute was never going to end! “I guess I better trust my instincts then!” Tallia sighed.

She slowly walked up to a piano that was waddling around the pan flute. “Umm...hello?” Tallia started.
“Eww. What are you?” The piano sang (yes, I said sang!).
“I’m Tallia. I was hoping you could tell me where I am right now? I fell through the sky onto this pan flute.”
“Ohh. I’m sorryyyyyyyyyyyy! You have hailed from on different plannnnneeet! I have learned about humans like youuuu! You come from the planet Earth! And have landed on planet Musicorum!” 
“Planet Musicorum? I haven’t learnt about this planet in those space documentary thingies. Wait, but I was just playing my guitar, started floating into the sky and landed on this planet.”
“I know what happeeeeened! Did you wish for something before-ore-ore you played that guitar and then sang it!” 

“Yes, I did. I wished that I could live in a world of music.”
The piano gestured around with his hand as if to say “Well, there you gooooooooooo!”
A smile spread across Tallia’s face. “Oh my gosh! My wish came true! Bye piano!” 
Tallia ran away, her hair flowing behind her.
“I have a naaaaaaaaaame! It’s Roberto-Berto-to!” Roberto shouted after her.
As fast as she could, Tallia ran and listened to all the instruments playing each other (I know that sounds weird but it’s true! Or should I say: truuuuuuuuuuuuuue!) and sang along to their joyous music. It was all songs that she knew! After a while, she reached a row of houses, then another, then another, then another. “These houses all look familiar...” Tallia thought. “Sweet cheese, this looks exactly like my neighbourhood!”

Tallia wandered around the neighbourhood, staring in the windows and seeing a clarinet, two violins, five electric guitars and one keyboard. When she got to what looked like her house, she looked in the window and saw two classical guitars. She furrowed her eyebrows but then knocked on the door. One of the classical guitars appeared in the doorway and smiled at Tallia. “Why, hello Tallia dear! Your father’s  been waiting for you, my daughter!” Grinned the guitar (yes he weirdly had teeth!)
“Daughter?” Said Tallia.
Then, the other guitar appeared in the doorway. “Tallia! Sweetheart! We’ve been waiting for you ever since you made that wish an hour ago! Come on, give your mother a squeeze!” The guitar said, reaching her hands (yes they also had hands!) out to give Tallia a hug.

Tallia shook her head and the guitar’s arms dropped. “You guys know about my wish? Are you my parents on this planet? You do not look or sound like my parents on Earth.” 
“Yes dearie. We know about your wish! We don’t want any parents who aren’t instruments in your wish for a musical world, of course! We don’t sound or look like them because we’re not them!”
“Oh, okay. Can I go into the house?”
“Of course!” The guitars said in unison.
Tallia walked into the house, half happy half sad that her parents didn’t exist on this new planet.

The house looked completely different! There were instruments (not living ones.) hung on the walls and posters of different bands that Tallia had never heard of. She walked into her room and it was exactly the same! Even her guitar was still there! Tallia was overjoyed! She collapsed on her bed and instantly fell asleep. She was so tired because of all her running around the pan flute and dropping from the sky. The instant her head touched the pillow, she fell asleep. It seemed like no time had passed when the guitars gently shook her awake. “Come on darling.” The dad guitar said.
“You need to get yo for school.” The mum guitar said, stroking Tallia’s hair.

“School? I still have to go to school here? That’s not musical.” Tallia groaned, pulling her blanket over her head. 
“Oh don’t worry my dear. It’s where you learn about music! You can walk there yourself it’s at the same place it always is!” The dad guitar said.
Tallia walked to school, thinking of all the times her parents would bring her to school and how she would never thank them, just plug in her headphones and listen to music the whole way there. At school, they learnt about famous music artists, from Jimi Hendrix to Ariana Grande. Her friends weren’t there. Just instruments. Her teachers weren’t there. Just instruments. Her parents weren’t there. Just instruments. She wrote an essay on Taylor Swift and took a test about The Beatles. By the time the day was done, she was on a school bus. It wasn’t a bus though, of course, it was a gigantic bongo drum in wheels!

Tallia sighed and leaned her head against the window. She thought of all the times her parents would bring her home from school and they would ask how her day was, but she would just be humming a song and ignoring them. She felt a shard of guilt in her chest and a tear ran down her cheek. When she got back to the house, she lay on her bed and thought for a bit. She decided that she missed her parents more than she wanted a world of music. She walked into the living room, where the guitars were tuning each other. “Umm...guitar people? I...I...don’t want to live in the music world anymore. I don’t want to hurt your feelings but I want my real parents!”

The guitars looked at her lazily. “You can’t hurt our feelings. You didn’t hurt our feelings. We’re just a couple of guitars who get messages from the musical government about people who made wishes about a musical world and do our best to grant them. But sooner or later they all give up on a musical world and just want to play music on Earth. We always get notifications about where they live and where their school is and information like that. So if you want to go back home, just sing your wish and play it on an instrument.” The mum guitar said, tuning the dad guitar’s strings.
Tallia was flabbergasted. She wasn’t ready to take in that whole clump of information at once. But she did. She grabbed her guitar and gulped. 

Did she really want to go back to the world that she came from? Did she want to have the same hassle of having to play her music ever so quietly? “Yes.” Tallia thought. “For my parents.” 
“I wi-i-i-sh I could go baaaaaaaaaaaack...to my ho-o-o-oooooooome.” Tallia sung, strumming her guitar. 
The same purple swirl appeared in the air and Tallia walked nonchalantly towards it. She shut her eyes tight as she rose up into the air and did the same as she was plummeting back down towards the Earth. She landed right where she was laying before, having a straight view of her guitar. She sighed happily. “Home sweet home.” Tallia said to herself.

She jumped up and ran into the living room, where her mum was on her laptop and her dad was quickly writing something in a notepad. “Mum, dad?” Tallia said, smiling.
Her parents put down their things and nodded, as if to say “Yes? What would you like? We’re listening.”
“I just wanted to tell you that...I love you guys. And I’m sorry I always ignore you when you bring me and take me home from school. I’m sorry I’m always ungrateful for everything you do for me just because I hate how you don’t like music and that therefore I cannot play music. I’m sorry that I carried on my music even thigh you guys hate it. I’m sorry I didn’t respect your opinion. But I am willing to now, and I am willing to stop playing music altogether just for you.” Tallia smiled.

Her parents’ jaws dropped open. They had never expected that their daughter would give up music altogether just for them! “Sweetheart! My gosh, we would love that!” Her parents laughed excitedly, almost in unison.
They all hugged. A kind of hug where you couldn’t see Tallia’s small frown or know how she was feeling. She was happy that she was back home and that now, she and her parents could go a day without an argument (because they only really argued about Tallia’s music.). But living without music was going to be hard for Tallia. She didn’t regret her decision, but now, taking her parents out if the picture, she saw how her decision would change HER life. She was completely right. For the next few months, Tallia became as sad as ever. Life without music was the worst. They had given away her guitar.

One day, when Tallia was daydreaming about her guitar, her parents slowly walked into her room. “Darling.” Her dad started. “We have come to a decision.” 
“About?” Tallia asked, hopping up and going to sit on her desk chair. 
“About your music.” Tallia’s mother smiled.
Tallia’s eyebrows popped up and she shook her knotty hair away from her face. “We have decided that you should get your music back. You’ve been so miserable in these past few months. We will learn to love if it you will. We can tell that your heart desires your one true passion. Music!” Her dad grinned, walking out of the hallway and coming back in with something in his hands that made Tallia cheer.

Her dad had a honey brown guitar in his hands and both if her parents had soft smiles on their faces. Tallia hugged her parents, squeezing them tight then snatched the guitar from her father’s hands! She played a chord on it, then turned it over. There was the unicorn sticker! “We got it back from the person we sold it from and gave another thing to them instead.” Her mum grinned. 
“Thank you, thank you, thank you! What did you give away?” 
“Just your headphones and yPod!”
“WHAT?!”
“Your dad’s just kidding! We gave away an old doll that you never use!” Tallia’s mum laughed.
Tallia sighed in relief.

From that day on, she played music on a schedule. When her mum and dad weren’t doing work. Whenever she played, she always remembered Planet Musicorum.
